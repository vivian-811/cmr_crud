Today, there is an excess of worldly science, it has become ‘above normal’; It needs to regain normality. People will only find happiness if this happens. The discoveries, that are being made, are above normal and yet we cannot find what we are looking for. What does this indicate? It shows that we are lost. Whenever anything occurs in excess, it leads to its exhaustion.
